# Select2 Bootstrap CSS

This is a bare bones stylesheet for making select2 fit in with bootstrap a bit better.

The LESS file is located at lib/select2-bootstrap.less, and the SCSS file is located at lib/select2-bootstrap.scss.

Tests are included to verify that LESS and SCSS compile down to the target CSS. To run the tests, you'll need to install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Less](http://lesscss.org/), and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/). Then you can run:

    npm install && bower install
    npm test
